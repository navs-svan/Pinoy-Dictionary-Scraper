# Pinoy Dictionary Scraper

A Python script that extracts terms and definitions from the Tagalog, Cebuano, Hiligaynon, and Ilocano Dictionaries in [Pinoy Dictionary](https://www.pinoydictionary.com/) using the _requests_ and _BeatifulSoup_ library. Multithreading was used to speed up the execution time of the script (I/O bound process).
